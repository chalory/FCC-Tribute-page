      <ul id="info">
      <li><strong>19 Aug 1920</strong> - Born in Lubuagan , Kalinga, Philippine Islands.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>December 1941</strong> he Imperial Japanese soldiers landed on Northern Luzon and began the conquest of the Philippines. The Fil-American forces chose to seek haven in the town of Lubuagan, Magdalena’s home, and made the Mission House their battalion headquarters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> 6 May 1942</strong> Magdalena joined the missionaries’ wives and other officers who chose not to lay down their arms in their retreat to Magnao in Tabuk, Kalinga.Soon, however, the Japanese ordered them to surrender. The small group turned themselves in and was imprisoned at Camp Holmes, joining Horan’s troops. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> 13 August 1942</strong> 
        Six days before her birthday. As the weeks passed by in incarceration, Magdalena learned Nippongo, the Japanese language.

        <strong> December 1942</strong> 
        , after almost five months in jail, Magdalena received an early Christmas gift: her freedom. She was set free under the auspices of Rev. Karl Eschbach, a Baguio-based missionary of her church. The young woman sought out her widowed mother and younger brothers and sisters in Agoo, La Union. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1943</strong>  traveled south to Manila and met her American missionary friends, Rev. Mary Stagg of the Cosmopolitan Church, Helen Wilke, and the Darvey sisters. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>January 1944</strong> Magdalena Leones was ordered by agent “AZ-48” to collect rosters of guerrilla forces in Northern Luzon. Recruited as spy by Colonel Russell Volckmann, the USAFIP, NL commander
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> 27 February to March 1944</strong> 
         went down to the plains of Pampanga to exchange intelligence information with the resistance leaders there. She then proceeded to Manila to secure urgently needed medical supplies from a contact nurse working at the Doctor’s Hospital—a task none too easy, for carrying such provisions through checkpoints carried the risk of arrest and punitive action. Along the way, Maggie obtained information on enemy dispositions and installations in the whole Pampanga province and in the towns along the national highway from Manila to San Fernando, the bustling port of La Union.

In the next months, Maggie went back and forth between the mountains and the lowlands to ferry vital intelligence reports. She even journeyed as far south as the Bicol region in search of radio technicians and radio parts, as well as to buy medical supplies and distribute funds to fellow guerrilla agents.

Maggie was eventually formally enlisted into the Philippine Army and inducted into the USAFIP, NL. Exploit after exploit soon earned her a promotion to corporal before the year ended. As the US 6th Army landed on the beaches between Lingayen in Pangasinan and Damortis in La Union on D-Day, 9 January 1945, the resistance movement erupted into full action, guns blazing and grenades exploding. Maggie was in the thick of the action, serving her country with her usual intelligence work and other services.

      <li>
        <strong> 18 July 1945, </strong> 
        As the Filipino guerrillas were delivering the penultimate blows to General Yamashita’s once-mighty forces, Colonel Volckmann recommended that Maggie be awarded the U.S. Silver Star, the third-highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of any branch of the United States armed forces.

        <strong>1962</strong> Leones moved to California from the Philippines in 1969. She worked as a clerk at Pacific Bell, owned homes in Richmond and in San Jose and did not talk much about her war exploits, according to her offspring.

        Leones passes away at San Jose, Santa Clara, California, USA</li>
